# Arduino-Beverage-Dispenser
interface and control for a drink based vending machine. TEJ3M
## Explanation/Summary
Grade 11 computer engineering project created by Eric Wei, Albert Tran, and Edward Golshenas. 
The machine is operated by 2 Arduino's; one being in charge of LCD interface and RFID scanning and the other carrying out the pump commands and action. Features 3 drink options and sizes, as well as a card payment system recognizing unique and new users.
## Prerequisites for Project
### Materials
2 Arduino UNO's
2 12 volt brushless pumps
RFID Scanner ()
3 LED Buttons
12 to 5 Volt Converter
2X16 LCD Screen
resistors,diodes, and other common hardware components
### Libraries and other Installations
[RFID Library](https://www.velleman.eu/products/view/?id=435568)
## Extra Notes and Precautions
### Cleaning
Make sure to run the machine with water to clean the pipes when not used for a long period of time. The drink storage must be held below the top of the dispenser in order to avoid flowing between uses and siphoning of extra liquid.
### Custom Purchasing and Running
In order to start the interface, one must tap the "tap" sign on the right with a RFID signal of any sort (keyfobs, ttc presto cards, debit cards). The button to the right is used to enter and the buttons below are for selection.
